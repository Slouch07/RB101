# A method that takes two Arrays as arguments, and returns an Array that contains all of the values from the argument Arrays.

# Mental Model: create a method that takes two arrays as arguments and combine those arguments into a single array.

# Questions:
  # new array object?
  # does it matter the order the two arrays are combined in?
  # this is not a single array with nested arrays?

# Explicit Rules:
  # There should be no duplication of values in the returned Array, even if there are duplicates in the original Arrays.

1. A method that returns the sum of two integers.
   Casual
   -------
  -Create a method that takes two numbers as arguments.
  -Ask the user for the first number and store it in a variable as an integer.
  -Ask the user for the second number and store it in a variable as an integer.
  -Add the two numbers together and assign to a variable.
  -Print the variable.

  Formal
  -------
  START

  Method definition:
    GET first_number
    SET first_number
    
    GET second_number
    SET second_number

    SET result = first_number plus second_number
    PRINT result
  END


2. A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings
   concatenated together.
   Casual
   -------
   -Define a method that takes an array of strings as an argument.
   -Iterate through the array as long as there is another element.
   -Add the value of each index of the array to the same variable.
   -Concatenate each index value within the variable.

   Formal
   -------
   START
    method definition
    count = 0
    WHILE count < length of array
      SET string = string + array[index]
      count += 1
    END
    PRINT string
   END

3. A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other 
   element.
   Casual
   ------
   -Define a method that takes a single array argument.
   -Iterate through the array selecting every other element.
   -Place every other element from old array into a new array.
   -Print out the new array.

   Formal
   -------
   START
    method definition
    count = length of array
    WHILE count > 0
      SET new_array = array_index
        IF array_index != 0 && array_index !% 0
      END
    END
    PRINT new_array
   END
